## Email

My email address is: cedric@cedricbonhomme.org

[My OpenPGP key](/files/cedric_bonhomme.asc) has the fingerprint:

```text
55F5 D60E EFCA 3591 0089 18E7 A1CB 94DE 57B7 A70D
```

I love hearing from people. But please, do not contact me in order to ask for
help or about an issue concerning one of my projects. It takes me too much time.
Use the dedicated issue tracker.


## IRC

'cedric' on Libera.Chat, usually in #python, #python-fr and some other channels.


## Instant messaging

I only communicate my [Matrix](https://matrix.org) and [Signal](https://signal.org)
identifiers with relatives. But you can still request.


## … or just follow

You can follow me using [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@cedric), or
[RSS](/blog/index.xml). 

I might not reply to social media DMs and eventually via IRC (unless you get my
attention).
