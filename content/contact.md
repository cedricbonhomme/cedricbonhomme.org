## Email

My email address is: cedric@cedricbonhomme.org

[My OpenPGP key](/files/cedric_bonhomme.asc) has the fingerprint:

```text
55F5 D60E EFCA 3591 0089 18E7 A1CB 94DE 57B7 A70D
```

I really enjoy hearing from people. However, if you have a question or issue
related to one of my projects, please use the dedicated issue tracker instead
of reaching out to me directly. Handling support requests personally takes more
time than I can afford — the tracker helps keep things organized and manageable.


## IRC

'cedric' on Libera.Chat, usually in #python, #python-fr and some other channels.


## Instant messaging

You can contact me via [Matrix](https://matrix.org): @cedric:matrix.circl.lu


## … or just follow

You can follow me using [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@cedric), or
[RSS](/blog/index.xml). 

I might not reply to social media DMs and eventually via IRC (unless you get my
attention).
