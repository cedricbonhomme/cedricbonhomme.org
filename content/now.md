Here's what I do now, when this page was updated on August 24, 2024.  
This page is inspired by [a good idea from Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about).


## Life

I am now 40 years old. Not doing too badly!

I’m trying to exercise more and can now easily run 10 km in under an hour!
You can connect with [me on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/cedricbonhomme).

## Work

Working on various open-source projects (personally and professionally), mainly on
[Vulnerability-Lookup](https://github.com/vulnerability-lookup/vulnerability-lookup) and on
[Newspipe](https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/newspipe).  
You should have a look at Vulnerability-Lookup!


## Music

Having fun playing piano.


## Reading
