Here's what I do now, when this page was updated on November 24, 2025.  
This page is inspired by [a good idea from Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about).


## Life

I am now 41 years old. Not doing too badly. I’d even say I've never been this strong!

I’m trying to exercise more and can now easily run 15 km!
You can connect with [me on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/cedricbonhomme).

Gardening and working more outside because it helps me clear my mind.

Maybe getting rid of alcohol. I haven’t had a drop of alcohol for a couple of weeks now. I’m a moderate drinker, but I think I should just stop. Drinking alcohol feels so old-school nowadays.


## Work

I still love my job. It’s exciting, diverse, full of opportunities, and brings me into contact with so many people. I learn something new every day.

Working on various open-source projects, mainly on
[Vulnerability-Lookup](https://github.com/vulnerability-lookup/vulnerability-lookup) and on
[Newspipe](https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/newspipe).  
You should have a look at Vulnerability-Lookup!  
I will release a major update of Newspipe before Christmas. I am working on this project since 2010.

Learning “AI” and forecasting mathematical models. Because why not.

I am trying to write more papers and attend more conferences.


## Music

Having fun playing the piano and working on more classical pieces. By the way, I’m listening to more and more classical music these days. It’s crazy.
I’d like to go to more classical performances as well.

My daughter has been playing the double bass for three years now. And my son just started electric guitar. He loves classical music.
