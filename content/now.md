Here's what I do now, when this page was updated on July 8, 2024.  
This page is inspired by [a good idea from Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about).


## Life

[I am](https://pixelfed.social/i/web/post/728163567326126383) now 40 years old.
Not doing too badly!

I try to find time for photography and I even publish various shots
on [my Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/_ecbo_/).

## Work

Working on various open-source projects (personally and professionally), mainly on
[Vulnerability Lookup](https://github.com/cve-search/vulnerability-lookup) and on
[Newspipe](https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/newspipe).  
You should have a look at Vulnerability Lookup!


## Music

Having fun playing piano.


## Reading

Un homme dangereux written by Alexandre Kauffmann.
