Here's what I do now, when this page was updated on May 30, 2025.  
This page is inspired by [a good idea from Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about).


## Life

I am now 40 years old. Not doing too badly. I’d even say I've never been this strong!

I’m trying to exercise more and can now easily run 15 km!
You can connect with [me on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/cedricbonhomme).

Gardening more because it helps me clear my mind.


## Work

Working on various open-source projects, mainly on
[Vulnerability-Lookup](https://github.com/vulnerability-lookup/vulnerability-lookup) and on
[Newspipe](https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/newspipe).  
You should have a look at Vulnerability-Lookup!

Learning “AI”.

I am trying to write more papers and attend more conferences.


## Music

Having fun playing piano.


## Reading

Haunted Houses Creak, by M. H. Altis.
