Here's what I do now, when this page was updated on June 1, 2022.  
This page is inspired by [a good idea from Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about).


## Life

Taking care of my family.

Finishing, slowly, [this house]({{< ref "/tags/maison/" >}}). Currently mainly working
in the garden.


## Work

Working on various open-source projects (personally and professionally).

Released an important update for [Freshermeat](https://git.sr.ht/~cedric/freshermeat).


## Music

Having fun playing piano.  
Let's prepare some kind of formation with Élisabeth and her
[double bass](https://pixelfed.social/p/cedric/406707864129893909)
We will be ready in a few years… or months for an early test. For the moment we try
to practice everyday. At least, it's what I do ;-)


## Reading

Finished “[Premier sang](https://www.librarything.com/work/26967806)”.
Now reading “[Une auberge dans la tempête](https://www.librarything.com/work/28133662)”.


## Misc

Just planed the next holidays for this summer !

Ramping up my workouts like I never did.

Thinking about a brand new website… it's a surprise.

Almost stopped watching TV (Netflix and all the rest…) since months.
