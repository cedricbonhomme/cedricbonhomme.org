Here's what I'm doing now (page updated February 7, 2026).  
This page is inspired by [a good idea from Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about).


## Life

I'm 41 — not doing too badly.

I'm exercising more and can now comfortably run 15 km. You can connect with
[me on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/cedricbonhomme).

I'm gardening and spending more time outdoors — it helps clear my mind.

I'm considering giving up alcohol. I haven't had a drop since November 9, 2025; I'm a moderate
drinker, but I think it's time to stop.

I've decided to take part in the ING Marathon — the half-marathon, actually.
Wish me luck.


## Work

I still love my job: it's exciting, diverse, and brings me into contact with many people. I learn
something new every day.

I'm working on various open-source projects, mainly
[Vulnerability-Lookup](https://github.com/vulnerability-lookup/vulnerability-lookup) and
[Newspipe](https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/newspipe). You should check out Vulnerability-Lookup.

I'm learning AI and forecasting models.

I'm trying to write more papers and attend more conferences.


## Music

I'm enjoying playing the piano and working on more classical pieces. I'm listening to more classical
music these days and would like to attend more performances.

My daughter has played double bass for four years, and my son just started electric guitar — he
loves classical music.
