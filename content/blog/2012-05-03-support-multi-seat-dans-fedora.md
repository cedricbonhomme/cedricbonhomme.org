Très [intéressant][1], il faudrait [tester][2] [ça][3].

> Oh, and BTW, as Ubuntu appears to be &#8220;focussing&#8221; on &#8220;clarity&#8221; in the &#8220;cloud&#8221; now ;-), and chose Upstart instead of systemd, this feature wont be available in Ubuntu any time soon. Thats (one detail of) the price Ubuntu has to pay for choosing to maintain its own (largely legacy, such as ConsoleKit) plumbing stack.
