I am thrilled to announce the release of
[Newspipe](https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/newspipe) version 10.0.0,
a project I started working on over 13 years ago!

The standout addition in this release is the ldap-auth support,
along with a host of other notable improvements. And small bug fixes.
For a detailed list of changes, please refer to the
[changelog](https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/newspipe/releases/tag/v10.0.0).

Newspipe continues to uphold its user-friendly and streamlined design
maintaining its core simplicity. Personally, I have relied on this tool
for over a decade, putting it through its paces with various technologies and features.

Your contributions are highly welcome!
Whether it's code improvements, feature suggestions, or reports on any
unexpected behavior. Remember: a surprised user is a happy user!
