The new version of [pyHIDS](https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/pyHIDS)
offers the integration of
[MISP](https://github.com/MISP) and of
[YARA](https://github.com/virustotal/yara).

A MISP server can be queried in order to find potentially malicious files from the
checksums in the database of pyHIDS.  
The YARA module allows you to provide a set of YARA rules to apply to the
monitoried files.

As a reminder,
[a recent previous version]({{< ref "/blog/2023-08-04-pyHIDS-0-6-1.md" >}})
of pyHIDS introduced the integration of
[Hashlookup](https://github.com/hashlookup) and of
[Pandora](https://github.com/pandora-analysis).

To be honest, I'm pretty happy with this new version.

Of course, you are invited
[to submit](https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/pyHIDS/issues)
your ideas of new features!
