I'm pleased to announce the release of **Stegano 2.0.0**!

After a series of minor releases, the Stegano project reaches a new milestone with a great new feature.

### Notable changes

Hide and reveal messages in PCM encoded .wav files. Your secrets now have a soundtrack!

The command line interface has been updated to let you use this new feature directly from your shell.
It's quite convenient if you install Stegano using pipx.

### Other minor changes

- Improved type annotations.
- Updated dependencies.


Stegano is a pure Python steganography library designed to make hiding messages in plain sight easy and educational.
Whether you’re experimenting or building something more serious.
