Dear happy readers and runners,

I’m running the ING Night Marathon Luxembourg (half marathon) on 16 May 2026. It will be my first half marathon and I’m excited — and a little nervous.


I’ve been working on becoming a better runner [since around 2016]({{< ref "/blog/2016-08-24-augmented-self.md" >}}). Over the years I made steady efforts: short, regular runs, slowly increasing my long-run distance, learning to pace myself, and prioritising recovery (especially this point 🙃). It hasn’t always been linear — there were busy periods and slow months — but I really feel I’ve evolved since those early years. Today I have more endurance, better pacing, and a calmer mindset on race day, and this half marathon feels like a milestone for that long-term progress — though it’s only one step. Finally, I genuinely enjoy running — I no longer have to force myself to go for a run.
I’m still in good shape: no knee pain, no history of serious injuries, and overall I feel better than I did ten years ago.
I usually run routes with a lot of elevation (250–320 m for 10 km) and almost always run in the woods or out in nature, mostly on the same trails close to where I live. They’re beautiful runs, and I absolutely always run with music; here’s my evolving [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3U0UeI07OVTG4mNNqYCdEU?si=2aGz2VExT3uQaY-BLjQRSg&pi=s4qdkQKJTMitX).

My goal for the day is simple: just finish the race alive. I’m not following a strict training plan; I run whenever I can — often in the rain and, lately, in the cold, whether in the morning or the evening.

If you’d like to follow my training or send encouragement, you can [find me on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/cedricbonhomme) — your kudos truly help on long runs. They're my fuel!

If you’re running the race too, please say hello — I’d love to meet on the start line. And if you have race-day tips (clothing, pacing, nutrition), I’m all ears.

Thanks for the support — wish me luck! 🏃‍♂️✨
