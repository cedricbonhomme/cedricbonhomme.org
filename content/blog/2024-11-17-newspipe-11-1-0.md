I'm pleased to announce the release of **Newspipe 11.1.0**, introducing several enhancements to improve your experience.

## New Features

- **Dynamic Content Loading:** The homepage now loads article content only when it becomes visible, optimizing performance and reducing initial load times.
- **Security Advisory Detection:** A new command identifies various security advisories—such as CVEs, GHSAs, PySec, and CSAF reports—within articles from specified categories. The extracted data is automatically transmitted to the Vulnerability-Lookup API as sightings.
- **Feed Collections:** You can now view collections of feeds without requiring a user identifier, making feed management more flexible.

## Improvements

- **LDAP Documentation:** Enhanced for easier configuration and understanding.
- **Theme Enhancements:** Various improvements to the dark and light themes for a smoother visual experience.
- **Main Page Refinements:** Numerous updates to optimize and refine the main page layout and usability.
- **Icon Update:** All icons have been updated, and unnecessary ones removed, for a cleaner interface.
- **CSRF Protection:** Enabled globally to enhance security.
- **Dependencies Update:** Python and JavaScript dependencies have been updated to their latest versions.
- **Translations:** French translations have been updated.
- **Smooth Theme Switching:** Enhanced light/dark theme transitions for a flicker-free experience.

As Newspipe approaches its 15th anniversary, I invite you to explore the latest version.
