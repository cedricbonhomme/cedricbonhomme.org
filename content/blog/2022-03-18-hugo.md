You may have noticed some turbulence recently here. Especially in the RSS stream.
It will now calm down, promised. What happened ?

After [14 years]({{< ref "/blog/2008-10-17-hello-world.md" >}}) rolling with WordPress,
I've finally decided to change for a static website. It is generated with
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io). I was thinking about this for some time.

The new address is https://www.cedricbonhomme.org and the feed for your aggregator
is available at https://www.cedricbonhomme.org/blog/index.xml.  
Please, update your bookmarks! Else you will miss a lot of awesome posts ;-)

Articles from the database of WordPress are now stored in simple Markdown files.
All original articles are available on this brand new blog.
In addition, I took care to not break previous
URIs: [example](https://blog.cedricbonhomme.org/2008/10/17/hello-world/).
You know, [Cool URIs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI).

The migration from WordPress to Hugo was very easy
thanks to a WordPress plugin. Despite the fact that I had to manually fix a lot of
internal links between the articles and links to pictures (yes, I managed to recover
all resources: pictures and various files).
The work is not finished yet, but the current state is pretty good.

I like to write new posts in a simple local text editor. The WYSIWYG editor of WordPress
was becoming a pain for me. Since the last three years, to be honest.  
It is now even easier to paste snippets of code. The rendering is pretty decent.  
The templates used by the [theme](https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole) are very clean
and easy to customize for somebody like me. I already made two contributions (one fix
and one feature) for this theme. I plan to make other pull requests.  
I also discovered the [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/),
a really nice Hugo feature.

Another reason is Git. The versioning of the content, decentralized backup and
simple deployment. I can just push new articles over SSH or use a deployment
workflow (for the time being I am using a Makefile…).

The simplicity of static websites is another important point. No database, no PHP
and no PHP extensions. It's really fast. Fast to build, for me. Fast to be displayed
for the readers, you.  
No more login screen to a dashboard. No more HTML forms.
No password, no two factor authentication, no user account.

I won't argue with the traditional "WordPress is not secure" thing. It's bullshit. The
WordPress community is big, dynamic and reactive with security issues. But, there are
people who should not manage a website.

Finally, I'm very happy with this decision. I am sure it won't be re-migrated to
WordPress in a few years.
