Aidez le service national des renseignements des États-Unis à définir la collection de
données.

> [[..]Director of National Intelligence James Clapper likened the NSAs accumulation of data to a library. All those books are stored on the shelves, but very few are actually read. &#8220;So the task for us in the interest of preserving security and preserving civil liberties and privacy,&#8221; says Clapper, &#8220;is to be as precise as we possibly can be whe we go in that library and look for the books that we need to open up and actually read.&#8221; Only when an individual book is read does it count as &#8220;collection,&#8221; in government parlance.  
> So, think of that friend of yours who has thousands of books in his house. According to the NSA, hes not actually &#8220;collecting&#8221; books. Hes doing something else with them, and the only books he can claim to have &#8220;collected&#8221; are the ones hes actually read.[..]][1]

Ainsi la surveillance de masse non ciblée n'est pas de la collection de données.

Vous vous rappelez peut-être de James R. Clapper, le directeur des renseignements qui [ne sait pas mentir][2].
