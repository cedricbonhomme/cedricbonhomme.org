The goal of this project is to write down all friends, in the broad sense, you ever had.
This lovely idea is from [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs).

It's not only about friends in the conventional sense. It's about:

- your current friends and loves;
- childhood friends you haven’t seen since you were a kid;
- old crushes (romantic or not);
- teachers;
- random encounters with great conversations;
- … all those that made an impact.

You can do the same. You must only use your memory.
The list does not necessarily need to be fixed.
It's important to keep making new friends as you get older.  
You might have forgotten some, and some might have forgotten you.
Remember all those people you met and connected with that made a difference in your life.


So here is the list of people who have permanently affected me. It is sorted
chronologically.

- Mathieu Stumpf
- Fabrice Brun
- Amandine Gross
- Steve Goddard
- Mickael Gerne
