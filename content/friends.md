The goal of this project is to write down all friends, in the broad sense,
you ever had. It's about:

- current friends;
- childhood friends you haven’t seen since you were a kid;
- teachers;
- old crushes;
- random encounters with great conversations;
- … all those that made an impact.

You can do the same. You must only use your memory.

You might have forgotten some, and some might have forgotten you.
I did this many times in my head.  
So here is the list of people who have permanently affected me. It is sorted
chronologically.

If you find this some day when Googling your name, [drop me an email](/contact).
