We welcome a new family member in our house. It's a baby. Just like 7 years ago.

Even though I can play a little with it, it's Élisabeth's double bass and she is already
way better than me.

Until recently, she could only practice with the one of the music school. I find it a
little amusing to see a 7 year old child with an instrument of this
size. A 1/8 bass... Long live!

And [happy birthday]({{< ref "/post/2015-04-25-sudo-adduser-elisabeth.md" >}})
Élisabeth !
