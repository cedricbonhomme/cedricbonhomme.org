Since the month of March there is [now page](/now) on this website.
You may have noticed it. I added it after the migration from WordPress.

Most websites have a link that says “about” or “contact”. People also use
micro-blogging services to provide various kind of updates to their relatives
(or followers). A now page tells you what a person is focused on, at some
point in their life. Think of what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year.
It's the main goal.

So I like the idea of this page. Not convinced ? See
[why you could make one](https://nownownow.com/about).

Just in case you are wondering, I am Currently not interested in a “Uses” page.
