After one year and nine months, Newspipe 9.5.0 has been released !

This release includes new commands and a new blueprint dedicated to the stats.

An important fix related to the management of the tags for bookmarks is finally ready.

Last but not least, many improvements to the code. Dependencies are now up-to-date.
The Web graphical interface is completely migrated to Bootstrap 5. jQuery has been
removed.
