I’ve recently released Freshermeat 0.8.1 and Freshermeat 0.8.0, which contains bug
fixes, some backend improvements (especially for the CVE fetcher)
and a brand new API based on the Flask-RESTX library. Migrating to the new API was a lot
of work.

The only known service based on Freshermeat is available
[here](https://open-source-security-software.net) and is dedicated to open source
security projects. Do not hesitate to
[submit](https://open-source-security-software.net/submit/) your project. I operate this
instance.

An OpenAPI Specification of the API
[is available](https://open-source-security-software.net/api/v2/). You can play with it.

For more details you can read the release notes
[here](https://git.sr.ht/~cedric/freshermeat/refs/v0.8.1)
and [here](https://git.sr.ht/~cedric/freshermeat/refs/v0.8.0).

That’s all for now!
