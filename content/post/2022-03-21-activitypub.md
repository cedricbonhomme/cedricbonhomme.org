This is what I love with
[ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) and the
[Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse):
the federation.  
It's really cool. Everything is connected and pretty fast.

You can post an activity somewhere (for example a photo on PixelFed or video on PeerTube),
share it on Mastodon. You get a comment about this activity somewhere else. And
you can reply to this comment from another place.

By the way, you should really consider trying
[Pixelfed](https://github.com/pixelfed). It's a really nice community and
Pixelfed is a great piece of software. No ads, no "algorithm", no NFT. No bullshit.

Same for the [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org) community. Not too small,
not too big. People are really great. Admins are awesome
(this is why I already decided to [help](/donations) them financially). Thank you guys !
You are like friends.

With the Fediverse it's easy to build a cozy community around a topic (of course
communities are connected, they are not islands).
A community is moderated by humans, and not strangers. You can discuss with them.
It's even really easy to contact the developers, for example
[Gargron](https://mastodon.social/@Gargron) or [dansup](https://mastodon.social/@dansup).
They are really nice. Thank you !
