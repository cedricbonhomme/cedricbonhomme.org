The new version of [pyHIDS](https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/pyHIDS)
features the integration of
[Hashlookup](https://github.com/hashlookup) and
[Pandora](https://github.com/pandora-analysis).

You can install it from [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pyhids),
for example with pipx:

```bash
$ pipx install pyHIDS
$ export PYHIDS_CONFIG=~/.pyHIDS/conf.cfg
```

Example of usage:

```bash
$ pyhids gen-keys --size 2048
Generating 2048 bits RSA keys ...
Dumping Keys
Done.

$ pyhids gen-base --sign
Generating database...
2427 files in the database.

$ pyhids run --check-signature
Verifying the integrity of the base of hashes...
Database integrity verified.
Verifying the integrity of the files...
```

If you want to check the database of hashes against
Hashlookup and Pandora for known malicious files:

```bash
$ pyhids hashlookup

$ pyhids pandora
```
