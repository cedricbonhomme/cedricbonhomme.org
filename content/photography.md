As far back as I can remember, I have always had an affection for photography.
You can take a look at some of the photos I shared on various places:

- [my personal gallery](https://photos.cedricbonhomme.org)
- [PixelFed](https://pixelfed.social/cedric)
- [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cedricbonhomme)
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_ecbo_)

Most of these photos are under
[Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
license.

I rarely indulge in post-processing my photos; I prefer them Straight Out of the Camera (SOOC).
For me, the moment captured in a click is final, unaltered by editing.
Once I press the shutter, the essence is preserved.

I do not really care about the technology and quality equipment in photography
(cameras, lenses, etc.) and think the use of expensive professional tools is
overestimated.
