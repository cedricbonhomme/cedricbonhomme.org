Photography has always held a special place in my heart, ever since I can remember.
Feel free to explore some of my photos shared across different platforms:

- [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cedricbonhomme)
- [PixelFed](https://pixelfed.social/cedric)
- [my personal gallery](https://photos.cedricbonhomme.org)
- [500px](https://500px.com/cedricbonhomme)

Most of these photos are under
[Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
license. Feel free to use them.

I rarely post-process my photos; I prefer them Straight Out of the Camera (SOOC).
