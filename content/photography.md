As far back as I can remember, I have always had an affection for photography.
You can take a look at some of the photos I shared on various places:

- [my personal gallery](https://photos.cedricbonhomme.org)
- [PixelFed](https://pixelfed.social/cedric)
- [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cedricbonhomme)
- [500px](https://500px.com/cedricbonhomme)

Most of these photos are under
[Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
license.

I almost never post-process my photos. I like photos when they are
Straight Out of the Camera (SOOC). Once you press the shutter, it's done.

I do not really care about the technology and quality equipment in photography
(cameras, lenses, etc.) and think the use of expensive professional tools is
overestimated.
