I'm just an amateur photographer but as far back as I can remember,
I have always had an affection for photography.  
You can take a look at some of the photos I shared on various places:

- [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cedricbonhomme)
- [500px](https://500px.com/cedricbonhomme)
- [PixelFed](https://pixelfed.social/cedric)
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_ecbo_)
- [my personal gallery](https://photos.cedricbonhomme.org)

Most of these photos are under
[Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
license. Feel free to use them.

I rarely post-process my photos; I prefer them Straight Out of the Camera (SOOC).

You're welcome to browse through the various [cameras](/cameras) in my collection.
