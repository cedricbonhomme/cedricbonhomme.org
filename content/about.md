I'm a computer scientist, intensely interested in computer security and privacy.
I strive to dedicate a significant portion of my life to contributing to open-source software.
I appreciate the art of computer programming since my childhood.

During the day, I work in the field of information security as part of a
Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT).
My role allows me to collaborate on exciting projects, respond to incidents,
and learn alongside an [incredible team](https://www.circl.lu/team).  
Here is a [resume](/files/resume_cedric-bonhomme_web-version.pdf) if you care.

I [contribute](/software) to various open-source projects mainly, but not only, in the infosec field.
My favorite programming languages are Python and OCaml.

Outside of computers, I’m interested in [photography](/photography).
As far back as I can remember, I have always had an affection for it.
I received my first camera when I was 8 years old.
I play the piano a lot. I also read books, though not as much as I would like.
Finally, I enjoy running in nature.
