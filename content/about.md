I'm a computer scientist, intensely interested in computer security and privacy.
I strive to dedicate a significant portion of my life to contributing to open-source software.
I appreciate the art of computer programming since my childhood.

During the day, I work in the field of information security as part of a
Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT).
My role allows me to collaborate on exciting projects, respond to incidents,
and learn alongside an [incredible team](https://www.circl.lu/team).  
Here is a [resume](/files/resume_cedric-bonhomme_web-version.pdf) if you care.

Outside of computers, I’m interested in [photography](/photography).
As far back as I can remember, I have always had an affection for photography.
I received my first camera when I was 8 years old.
I play piano, a lot. I also read books, but not as much as I would like.

I [contribute](/software) to various open-source projects mainly, but not only, in the infosec field.
I also develop open-source software in a [professional context](https://github.com/CIRCL).
I do not really prefer a specific programming language, despite the fact that I
enjoy using Python and OCaml.  

I think it's also important to make [donations](/donations) to the projects
I am relying on.
