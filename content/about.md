I'm a computer scientist, intensely interested in computer security and privacy.
I strive to dedicate a significant portion of my life to contributing to open-source software.
I appreciate the art of computer programming since my childhood.

During the day, I work in the field of information security as part of a
Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT).
My role allows me to collaborate on exciting projects, respond to incidents,
and learn alongside an [incredible team](https://www.circl.lu/team).  
Here is a [resume](/files/resume_cedric-bonhomme_web-version.pdf) if you care.

Outside of computers, I’m interested in [photography](/photography).
As far back as I can remember, I have always had an affection for photography.
I received my first camera when I was 8 years old.
I play piano, a lot. I also read books, but not as much as I would like.


## More about me

### It's all about open source

I [contribute](/software) to various open-source projects mainly, but not only, in the infosec field.
I also develop open-source software in a [professional context](https://github.com/CIRCL).
I do not really prefer a specific programming language, despite the fact that I
enjoy using Python and OCaml.  

I think it's also important to make [donations](/donations) to the projects
I am relying on.

I am desperate by the growing capitalist alternative of the Web and I support the Small Web.


### Minimalist

I’m disheartened by the increasing commercialization of the web and support initiatives like the Small Web. As a minimalist and low-tech enthusiast, I prefer simpler, more sustainable solutions. I value tangible, enduring tools like books, pens, and paper over digital alternatives like e-readers and "smart" devices. Among all my possessions, my piano holds a special place—it’s timeless, requires no technology, and offers a lifetime of joy and growth through practice.

This minimalist approach extends to my software and hardware preferences. I favor lightweight tools like Emacs and Kate for text editing and cherish the freedom of avoiding dependence on big tech companies, online services, and unnecessary subscriptions.


### Independent

I strive for independence in both my personal and professional life.
I avoid unnecessary debts, minimize reliance on the banking system,
and focus on spending time creating rather than consuming.
For me, the world needs more creation and thoughtfulness—not just audiences.


### Parenting

Despite my commitments, I make quality time with my children a top priority.
In a fast-paced world, I do my best to teach them, enjoy our moments together, and encourage their curiosity.


### The Value of Effort
I’ve always believed in the importance of effort and embracing challenges.
Discomfort makes you stronger, and hard work is rewarding.
I began focusing more on physical activity at 32 and quickly felt stronger than I did in my 20s.
This principle also guides my approach to material possessions—I value enduring items over
constant upgrades, whether it’s a watch, a car, or a camera.

Reading is another cornerstone of my philosophy. While modern platforms push us to consume movies or social media, books help keep the mind sharp and foster lifelong learning.


### Passionate

I always tried to do everything with passion and I think long-term.
As much in my private life as in my work.
If I feel that something out of my control is about to threaten my plans, I am
ready to take appropriate decisions to change this or to adjust the plan.
Most of the time it's not easy, but it's necessary. It's always better to put
more effort. This is how to be honest and respectful to others.

Ultimately, life is about doing what you love, contributing meaningfully, and finding joy in the journey.
