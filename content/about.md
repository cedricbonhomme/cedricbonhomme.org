I'm a computer scientist, intensely interested in computer security and privacy.  
I try to share and contribute in this world to the extent of my knowledge and
I have the chance to develop open source software in a professional context.
I appreciate the art of computer programming since my childhood.
Here is a [resume](/files/resume_cedric-bonhomme_web-version.pdf) if you care.

Outside of computers, I’m interested in [photography](/photography).
As far back as I can remember, I have always had an affection for photography.
I received my first camera when I was 8 years old.
I play piano, a lot. I also read books, but not as much as I would like.


## More about me

### Minimalist

I’m a minimalist and a low-tech guy. Passionate by \[computer\] science.
Secretly I do not like modern technology.
I like books, pen, papers and photos. I hate e-readers and “smart” devices.
Of all the things I own, the most important for me is probably my piano.

This principle is also valid when it comes to my tastes in software development
and with hardware.
My favorite programming languages are Python and OCaml and text editors of
choice are Emacs and Kate, depending on the project and my mood.


### It's all about open source

I try to dedicate a significant part of my life to promoting knowledge sharing
mainly, but not only, in the field of computer science. This is why my
[software projects](/software) and ideas are public and under copyleft licenses.
You can share, use and remix my work.
I do not really prefer a specific programming language, despite the fact that I
like Python and OCaml.  

I think it's also important to make [donations](/donations) to the projects
I am relying on.

I am desperate by the growing capitalist alternative of the Web and I support the Small Web.


### Independent

I do not want to depend on big tech companies, I avoid online services, the
cloud and try to run what I can myself. Or partly myself.

I also do not want to depend to much on the banking system (I avoid having debts),
and useless insurances. I hate subscription services because I want to spend
most of my time creating and thinking. Not consuming products. Our world do not
need more audience, but more creation.


### Introvert

I am a kind of introvert and I like to think, slowly, about many aspects of the
world. However, I am very comfortable when I am surrounded by people, for example,
at conferences. I don't feel the need to show, to be liked and I ignore those who don't
like me.

I make friends quite easily. I remember and still love [all of them](/friends).
I am fine when I am alone, so I know I have the best friends.

I do not fight against people with antagonist principles. Trying to fix the
society this way is a waste of time. It's extremely hard to
change people. I think that it's better to spend time for positive things, to create and
enjoy your transient life.
You could be an example, just by *doing*. And at worse, you did something.

People should be more individualist and altruistic, in the same time.
It's a matter of balance.


### Piano

I might have already said it: I love my piano. An instrument of music is the
only expensive thing you can buy and do not feel stupid. It works without
electricity, without subscription, without software. It just needs you and you
can enjoy it your entire life. To be good at it you need to learn and practice.
The rich can't buy this. Lazy people can't steal it. You can use it alone,
in duo or being part of a group.


## Parenting

Despite my work and passion for computer science, I do my best to spend a lot
of time with them. Which can be chalenging nowadays. I try to teach them
everything I can and of course to have fun together.


### It's fine if it's hard

I always valued efforts. Even when I was a teenager (a bit weird no ?).
Later when I was at the university. Today I tend as well to specifically value
more what has endured.
A watch that you are using since 10 years will be probably ready for another
decade. Same for cars, I do not change a working car. Do not buy a brand new
camera but try to make great photos with your current equipment.
Look for new ideas, techniques, skills, new places. It's more work but rewarding.

Hard effort is good for the body. Discomfort makes you stronger. Comfort makes
you age faster. I really started doing more sport when I was 32.
I quickly felt stronger than at the age of 20.

Reading books is good for you. Big companies do not forget to remind us to
finish a movie, watch a video, read Twitter. Who remind you to read books ?

Thanks to books you will keep the brain of a child. If you are constantly learning,
you do not age.


### Passionate

I always tried to do everything with passion and I think long-term.
As much in my private life as in my work.
If I feel that something out of my control is about to threaten my plans, I am
ready to take appropriate decisions to change this or to adjust the plan.
Most of the time it's not easy, but it's necessary. It's always better to put
more effort. This is how to be honest and respectful to others.

Finally, it's about enjoying life and doing what you love.
